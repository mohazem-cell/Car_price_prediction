## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Car_price_prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run data preprocessing**
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

4. **Train the model**
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Make predictions**
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py --input <input_data.csv>
   ```

## Usage

- Use the notebooks for interactive analysis and model development.
- Scripts in `src/` can be run from the command line for batch processing.
- The trained model in `models/` can be loaded for inference.
